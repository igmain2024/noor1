Oh It's Been a Month Already
## 7-26-22
A small retrospect on the past month since I've written the last blog post.
### A month goes by fast...
I looked at the date yesterday (7/25) and I was a little shocked that it's almost been a month since 
I wrote my last blog post. I thought I would recap what I've done since I finished the Pug switch. The
most noticeable switch is the color choice on the website.

The goal was the make the website look more "comfortable" to view. I'm not sure what the specific word is,
but the previous

with the purple and greyish-white did not blend well together. Now, I feel that the elements do blend
together better. I think this is because the boxes no longer harshly contrast with the background. Instead,
I mainly used shadows around the boxes to make them pop out subtly. I also added a link to my resum√© 
and began working on the index page. Currently, I am finishing the index page as well as making the website
mobile-friendly. 
### I love discussion posts
I am currently in week 4 of 8 for my summer quarter at Clark College. I will be graduating with my
Associate's in Science after this quarter! My schedule is digital photography, Survey of Biology, and a health class called Occupational Wellness. It's a fairly easy load, and I am actually working on assignments due days from now. In fact, I love discussion posts so much, I just did my posts for week 7 in my health class.

I'm kidding, I'm doing them because they're easy to get done. Most of my discussion posts (especially for
my health class) have been my opinion on a matter. I can spew my opinion in 200 words fairly quickly,
but doing my photography assignments have been a decent challenge. I am new to digital photography, and 
I have been struggling to find what to take pictures of. Don't get me wrong, I am still finishing assignments
early, however not at the same speed as my two other classes. Photography will be a nice skill to have,
however I wish I could have just taken a web development class to fulfill my art requirement. I think that makes
sense: a class about HTML/CSS for "art"? Front-end definitely is an art. Oh well.

Anyway, it is almost midnight, and I like to go to bed by 10pm. I should really get to bed. Until the next time!
