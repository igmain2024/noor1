# My First Blog Post!
## 6-13-22
A short story of why I wanted to make this website, and the process involved.
### It's official!
I am proud to say that I can officially post my first blog post on my website!
I have made a lot of progress since I began working on this website almost a month ago.
As of now, I can have a proper conversation with someone about HTML and CSS and I 
would know what they are talking about. The main reason why I wanted to make this website
was so that I could be experienced in web development. Web development always seemed
like a skill that everyone expects you to know, and yet I've never had any course
in my major cover any of it.
### The first spark
I took an introductory networking class, but as I have
came to learn, the class was more so about the lower level functionality of networks,
such as how packets of information transfer, how web URL GET requests work, and 
network packet transfer failure. I definitely do not regret taking the class, 
but it was not quite what I was looking for in my education. I wanted to learn how
to establish servers and how to set up database connections. There was one assignment
where I had to make an HTTP server that sends information over a TCP socket. The program
was written in Python 3, and it did not take that long to write. Looking back, it was
a fairly easy assignment. I believe that this assignment was the reason why my interest
grew in this website. I actually made a portfolio website for my senior project in 
high school (using

in an editor, no code was written), and I had an idea of some items I wanted to include
in a portfolio website.
### The beginning
After the end of my junior year in college (around May 16th), I began working on the website.
I first researched how web servers are made. I came to the decision to use Node.js as my
framework for the web server. Since my website is static my friends recommended to use other frameworks like Gatsby 
or React. Node is intended for dynamic websites, but 
there's no reason why it can't be used for a static website.  I decided to keep 
using Node since I was not familiar with any framework, and I didn't really 
feel that it mattered which one I used since I'm a beginner.  Eventually, I learned 
that I also needed to use Express.js, which is built on top of Node. In short, 
Express back-end apps are much cleaner and simpler to implement than Node apps.
Currently, I still host the server from localhost, meaning I am the only one that 
can access the website while the server is up. I have yet to find a domain name,
or a platform that will host the website. I am not familiar with that process, 
and I don't intend to publicly launch the website until I am satisfied with the
HTML pages. I would like to host the web server from my own scrap computer, however
I have yet to decide.

These are screenshots of the website as it looks now, I think it would be fun
to capture this now so that I can compare the look of the website later on.

What's pretty neat is that it even looks good in the dark mode web extension that I use,

### Wrap-up
I am very happy with the progress that I made, and I am excited to keep working
on the website! This is the end of this post for now, but I plan on writing
down more to document my process. There is a very strong chance that I will forget
to write more blog posts, but I will try my best. Thank you for taking the time
to read this post!
